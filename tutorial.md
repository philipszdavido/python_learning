In setting up a Python project, we create a file that ends with `.py`.

# Basic Data Types

## Number

They are just numbers

- Integers - `0 - 9` without decimal points, they are whole numbers.
- Floats - Numbers with decimal points e.g `8.9`, `9999.6765`, etc.
- Complex - `6i` it translates to this square-root of -6. 6i + 7j + 8k

## Boolean

They have two values: `True` or `False`. True can be represented as 1 while False is 0.

## String

"gfgfgfg"
"hey"
"where are you going?"

# Operators

Type of operations that can be performed in Python are:

Numerical operations
Multiplication - `*`
Addtion - `+`
Subtraction - `-`
Division - `/`
Square Rooting
Raise to power
any mathematical ops

Conditional operations
these are operation executed based on conditions that are met.
eg.
comaparing: ==, !==
